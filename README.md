# 2048Bot-PyAutoGui
A bot that plays 2048 using pyautogui to move the board and tell what is currently on screen. It can only reach into the thousands right now but I may improve on it so the bot can beat the game. I also want to configure the bot so that you do not have to configure the coordinates of the spaces before running it.
